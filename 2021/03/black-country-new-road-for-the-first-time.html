          <p>These days, it seems every post-punk band is rehashing the same formula and that's why the Windmill Brixton scene has been such a breath of fresh air in guitar music with genuine experimentation from the likes of Squid, black midi and the subject of today's post: Black Country, New Road. The band emerged in 2019 with 'Athens, France', introducing their obvious adoration for Slint with frontman Isaac Wood's spoken word delivery over cold, angular guitar riffs. 'Sunglasses' was their true breakout moment, packed with pop culture references and fully utilising their instrumental palette including guitars, <a href="https://alanbijuthomas.github.io/2020/07/jockstrap-wicked-city">violin</a> and saxophone. Likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on touring, <i>For the first time</i> was finally released in 2021 with 4 new tracks. 'Track X' is a minimalism-inspired chamber pop affair, repeating the motif from 'Sunglasses' while opener 'Instrumental' and 8-minute epic 'Opus' showcase the band's klezmer influence and their ability to build and release tension. 'Science Fair' is my favourite track on the record as Isaac recounts an awkward obsession while a flurry of dissonant instruments builds up to a suspenseful, noisy climax. Despite the overarching themes of alienation and anxiety, the band clearly possess a sense of humour with their stock image aesthetic and absurd lyrics such as 'She sells chemtrails / To the students at Bedales'. Black Country, New Road excel at crafting atmosphere and <i>For the first time</i> is a must-listen for fans of alternative music. With their bootlegged live shows circulating online and hype building by the day, I can't wait to see where they go next.</p>
