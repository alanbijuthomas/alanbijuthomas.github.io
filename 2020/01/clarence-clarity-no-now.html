          <p>Welcome to the first post of my blog. Now that we're in the 2020s, what better way to start than talk about my favourite album of the last decade? The album in question is English singer/songwriter and producer Clarence Clarity's <i>No NOW</i>. Described as "funk played by a swarm of bees" by The Guardian, it's an outstanding take on pop/R&B music which has been in my rotation ever since I first heard it back in 2015.</p>
          <p><i>No NOW</i> is dense, noisy and chaotic with a layer of glitch and glitter over 90s inspired R&B jams. With vocal manipulation, peculiar sampling and infectious instrumentation, Clarence manages to craft a futuristic, cryptic sound rivalled by no other. From the coin grab sound effects on 'Will To Believe' to the chopped vocal gibberish of 'Let's Shoot Up', this album is truly unique sonically. It  sounds like someone left a pop album in a particle collider. The lyrics may seem nonsensical on first listen but on deeper dives, discuss a myriad of taboo topics including narcissism, heroin abuse, porn addiction and religious contemplation. Every track is a hit but funky, psychedelic banger 'Those Who Can't, Cheat' is perhaps the best of the lot, with its pounding synths and distorted flute breakdown revelling in chaos.</p>
          <p>With even the 23-second 'TathƒÅgatagarbha' seemingly providing a break from the madness but actually augmenting the album's dark tone with inaudible echoes of "kill", there's not a missed moment over its 62-minute runtime. Listening to this album on a pair of good headphones has become a spiritual experience for me. While various experimental pop acts from the 2010s have received widespread acclaim, <i>No NOW</i> remains underrated and I highly recommend you give it a listen or two.</p>
