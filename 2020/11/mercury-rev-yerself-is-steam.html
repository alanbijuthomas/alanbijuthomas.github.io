          <p>Mercury Rev's debut record <i>Yerself Is Steam</i> has grown on me over the last year and now, it firmly ranks in my top 5 albums of all time. Far from the chamber pop of the band's canon record <i>Deserter's Songs</i>, it finds the band playing a sprawling fusion of noise and psychedelia that sounds distinctly 90s. The title's pun on ego death and the cover's depiction of a woman shrouded by a blurry haze give you an idea of what to expect.</p>
          <p>Every track on <i>Yerself Is Steam</i> features beautiful, dreamy melodies buried beneath chaotic, hysterical guitar noise. 'Chasing A Bee' is probably my most played song of 2020 and opens the record with a surreal performance from vocalist David Baker before descending into apocalyptic yet euphoric feedback-heavy guitar solos, anchored by a flute line and warm "la la la"s. 'Frittering' is the next best song on the record with its acoustic riff evolving into a hypnotic epic with swirling guitar explorations underneath. I must say that the tones achieved by Jonathan Donahue and Grasshopper on this album are some of my favourite ever and a major inspiration to me as a guitarist. It's also worth seeking out the angsty ballad 'Car Wash Hair', a bonus track on certain issues of this record and a fan favourite.</p>
          <p><i>Yerself Is Steam</i> may be jarring on first listen, but once those pop melodies start revealing themselves, you'll be hooked. And for fans of the crazier side of things, I'd say that this album features some of the best use of noise I've heard, always resulting in a cathartic experience whenever I listen to it.</p>
